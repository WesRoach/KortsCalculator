Updated 6/13/2007 - Version 2.01

  Show Endurance only for weapon using classes unless there are items
  with Fatigue or Fatigue Cap bonuses, show Power/Power % only for
  magic users unless there are items with Power/%Power/Power Cap.

  Added additional '5th slot' bonuses for the dragonsworn crafted items.

  Outfits now get properly updated when loading an item directly from 
  its XML file.

  Fixed saving items with bad class restrictions (or other non
  string entries) and knock out any class restriction on read if
  it is blank.

  Load resource file from appPath and not current working directory
  path. People who have template files mapped to open up KSCraft 
  automatically would see no icons.

Updated 4/26/2007 - Version 2.00 - in sync with DAoC 1.88

  Sum Archery/Spell bonuses as "Archery and Spell" bonuses,
  for total bonuses.  

  Aproximate the chances of success based on Mythic's half-hearted 
  post about chances to blow up.  Our approximation is full of .5%
  rounding errors (in both directions), which shouldn't make a big 
  difference.  The chance to succeed (and not blow up) appears to be
    34% + ItemQualModifier (6% to 26%) - OCPenalty(10 to 70%) 
        + SkillBonus (0% to 100%) - (SkillBonus - 100%) * OCPenalty / 2
  so 1000 skill crafters aren't affected, while the younger the crafter,
  with the larger the overcharge, the more the penalty affects them (a
  level 1 toon doing a 5 point overcharge would suffer a full 35% penalty 
  on top of the old formula, with a -45% (impossible) chance of success).

  Touched up layout of Ethinarg's search results view, the list
  now shows the item name as clickable link (instead of seperate
  "Add to Template" link) to add the item.  Added a Clear Query
  button to reset the form.

  Solved loading and switching outfits, loading a template
  now shows the selected outfit and each outfit's selected
  items correctly.

  Default to the first non-All Magic, non-All Melee skill
  so the user can enter an amount before choosing a skill.
  (All Magic/All Melee are restricted to an amount of 1).

  Fixed Ethinarg 'Add Item to Template' to display the slot
  choice for non-ring/wrist/weapon slots.

  Save new DaocIniPath in preferences (important for users
  not on an actual game PC.)  Select the first toon to help
  users who are often confused at first.  The display now
  shows the client (it digs 2 directories deep from the .ini
  files path to find them all).

  Added Material items to the SCItem/SLOT for report writers
  (only created by the output xml feature, not saved in the
  persistant templates).

  Akatsuki moved from the GOA/Euro list to the US list with
  their new server number, for exporting gems.  Updated all
  of the euro server numbers.

Updated 3/30/2007 - Version 1.99 - catch up to DAoC 1.88

  Search Ethinarg's Database grew a quickbar button.  It also 
  pops up a window prompting the user to choose a spot to stick 
  the item, when choosing to 'Add Item to template', from what 
  we can second-guess for good slot choices.  Solves a bug where 
  most rings could not be imported, and lets the user pick from
  left and right hand for rings and wrists, for example.

  For purposes of the Spellcrafting program, there are now three
  bonuses "Archery and Spell Damage", "Archery and Spell Range",
  and "Archery and Casting Speed" as was wrote by Mythic in the
  1.88 patch notes.  The game has yet to display these as such,
  but Archery now affects Spells and Spell now affects Archery.

  Removed Pathfinding for Rangers, changed bow-skills of Hunters,
  Rangers and Scouts and to all be 'Archery', and changed Airy War 
  gems to 'Archery' for 1.88.  Yes, it doesn't match the delve.
  The name may be adjusted again, later, just waiting to see.

  Although pre-1.88 crafted bonuses show up in game as Recurve Bow, 
  Composite Bow, or Archery, all will display in the Calculator 
  as 'Archery'.  For inquiring minds from Mordred and Gaheris, 
  they all affect all primary Archers.  'All Archery Skills' but 
  not 'Archery' will also affect Crossbow.  

  So imported items archery-skills will be changed to 'Archery', 
  and the user can switch them to All Archery Skills where it's 
  appropriate (this really only affects Crossbow classes).  This 
  is less misleading then changing items to say "All Archery Skills"
  when they are not, tricking Crossbow specs into adding such an 
  item to the template.  It is part of the reason the crafted-gem
  skill will show as "Archery" for now, as well.

  Many users were confused seeing "2 All Melee Skills" followed by
  "4 Slash" "4 Thrust" etc.  It IS added, but now to make clearer
  that it's a subtotal, it will show as "(2 All Melee Skills)".

  Have quit moving the maximized window around when changing options.

  Export Gems works again (it always did, actually) and will reset
  your path to your .ini files on first-use.  Your .ini files are
  being moved (as you log into them one by one) into your profile's
  Application Data\Electronic Arts\Dark Age of Camelot directory.
  This is the -new- default for export-gems path.

  If there is a program bug and a template or export document
  can't be prepared, the template or exported xml will no longer 
  be overwritten as a blank file.

  Now asking the user to please send in the Spellcraft.exe.log error 
  messages when the template XML can't be created to be saved, and
  asking the user to send in the Spellcraft.exe.log AND the template 
  when a template can't be reloaded due to XML, template or item 
  processing errors, in the error messagebox.

  If an equipped item is deleted or moved, the next item in the
  list will be Equipped at it becomes the selected item.

  Delete or Move item now updates all outfits that used to point
  at the removed item, and points them to the next item in this
  slot.  Outfits will continue to point to the same newly blank 
  item when the entire item or its slots are Cleared.

  Changed modality of progress box with Ethinarg search. Now it
  is only modal with regards to the Ethinarg search dialog.

  Added the 'location' search to the Ethinarg item search.

  Fixed encoding of spaces in item name with Ethinarg search.

  Ethinarg search options are now saved on program exit.

  When adding a found item to a template, there is a much more
  informative dialog box.

  Fixed spelling of Guinevere for our diehard roleplayers (who
  don't have alot of humor for spelling errors :)

Updated 03/09/2007 - Version 1.98

  You will find your Spellcraft.xml preferences file saved in
  \Documents and Settings\(you)\Application Data\KSCraft\
  on Windows or in ~/.kscraft/Spellcraft.xml on unix or mac.
  Your existing file will be renamed oldSpellcraft.xml in the
  program's directory.

  Added a second page of Item Info (the button switches between
  the Item Info and Item Slots views).  These include the Bonus,
  AF/DPS and Speed plus additional item Realm, Type and other 
  database item fields inspired by Ethinarg, a grid of the race
  restrictions, and per item notes.  The template notes moved 
  from the Options window to this display.

  Craft Times now work - either for the entire template (look
  beneath the Character Level) plus by-item (below

  Mythrian items will no longer affect the distance to bonus cap 
  (these cap-caps are now correctly raised).

  Fixed Configuration Report/Save Template to name all gems by the
  realm of the Character, not by the realm of the item.

  Added Enhanced Shield and Harp to the new item, item type menus.

  Split Clear Item from Clear Slots (we actually argued about what
  the feature was supposed to do, until we decided we aught to give
  users both features).

  Fixed Swap Gems (again).  For good this time, we hope.

  Squished the slots with a scrollbar when needed for good old 
  800x600 displays (we haven't heard of anyone still using 640x480
  and won't support them.)

  By popular request (and possibly to test Requirements at some point
  in a future patch) added Champion Level and Realm Rank to templates.

  EA Mythic US server ini file numbers now clash with Euro/GOA server
  ini file numbers, so US players saw the wrong server name for their
  characters.  Added a new Option to show Euro/GOA servers.

  When loading a classic template, don't throw away either the drop
  or crafted 'empty item' just because they have no slots filled in.
  Users -expect- to see an empty item waiting for them, it was there
  when they saved it.  We still collapse the empty drop or crafted
  item when an item, alone, is loaded.

  Added ability to search Ethinarg's database from within the 
  application and add found items directly to the current template.

Updated 01/30/2007 - Version 1.97

  Export Gems fixes: don't die looking for made gems, set the crafted
  gems to marked (but not checked), update the next quickbar slot
  after exporting, and disable the export button when there is no
  crafter or no gems chosen to export.  This makes it easier to see
  when gems are successfully exported.

  Changed the description from "Hide 'done' gems" to "Hide 'made' gems".

  Item renaming now works properly again (signal name broken in 1.96).

Updated 1/25/2007 - Version 1.96 - Patch 1.87 SC Overhaul

  Removed Quality factor entirely from gems.

  Removed Crafting Time tracking from gems.

  Change the concept of tracking 'remakes' to tracking 'makes',
  where zero makes is costed as if it will be one make, and one 
  or more makes are the actual number of gems that were imbued
  (replaced one-by-one as the crafter goes Kaboom.)

  Removed 'expected multiplier' because the SC'er doesn't know
  exactly when they will go Kaboom, and will replace only one
  gem if they plan ahead.  Imbued three with no overcharge, and
  hold off the overcharge gem so only one gem explodes if any

  Hide acuity-type stats that don't apply to the class if the stat
  has no bonus and display "ACU" for classes with no acuity stat
  when there is a useless bonus.

  Track makes on the main item info pane (where Quality used to be).

  Save the last View -> Toolbar preference and the toolbar's current 
  location (top/bottom/left/right) from session to session.  Fixed
  the Config Report button to bring up the correct report.

  Fix export gems so all Spellcrafting toons show up. It had choked
  on antique -###.ini toons when ### was an unknown server number.

  Total all remade gem costs by item and in grand total, this was 
  broken in 1.93.

  Patched Qt so that opening the ItemList with broken network drives
  or floppy drives doesn't timeout for > 10s.

Updated 01/17/2007 - Version 1.93 - The Last Old Flavor (Quality)

  ** This version preserves Quality for our European friends, until
  ** the crafting patch arrives on their hemisphere.  The number 1.94
  ** is reserved, in case some updates from 1.93 are necessary to
  ** hold them over until that day comes.

  Added 'Outfits' - An outfit is a collection each item selected for
  each tab.  Create multiple outfits (e.g. PvP, RvR, Buffing, etc...)
  in the same Spellcrafting template to make it easier to work out
  specific stats.  This works along with the feature added in 1.92 for
  multiple items per slot.  An Outfit ONLY keeps track of which item 
  is selected and if it is equipped.  If more than one outfit shares the 
  same item, and you modify it on one outfit, the changes appear on the 
  other outfits.  Create New Items when they really are distinct items,
  items, such as Gloves (Summoning), Gloves (RvR) and Gloves (PvP). 
  Name these items however you like by editing their Item Names.

  The main window now shows single-gem cost and not the estimated cost,
  no matter if multiple makes are already recorded, or if the quality
  would demand multiple makes.

  The utility calculation for hits has been fixed.

  Fixed Quickbar loading.  Mythic has changed the server codes with the 
  Labyrinth of the Minotaur expansion patch.

  Focus does not show up in the drop-down gem type lists on each effect
  if the character class you have selected does not have a focus skill.
  This feature is disabled with the 'Hide Non Class Skills' option.

  Updated mauler class gems for LoTM patch 1.85k

  Fixed item's Realm by assuming it is the realm of the class, for now.

  Overhauled saving preferences (options).

  Added a toolbar with icons for easier access to common functions like
  New Template, Save Template, New Item, Save Item, Load Item, etc.

  Fixed a bug with the 'Save as Text' option for config reports where
  non-printable characters were showing up in the output.
  
  Memory usage has been cut in half.  On program startup it should be down 
  to around 30MB.

Updated 11/04/2006 - Version 1.92

  IMPORTANT: Leladia Template support is dropped for good.  If you have 
  any old template files from Leladia's calculator, open and save them
  in an older version of Kort's, then you can load them in the current
  version of Kort's.

  IMPORTANT: Combined the Power and Hits effects into the "Stat" effects
  list.  Sorry to confuse some of you, but this makes room for more things
  especially in the drop effect-type list.

  AF and PP% (Power Pool %) are now in the stat list. Added Essense resist.  

  Load Item now defaults to the 'All\(slots) directory, if there is no 
  (realm)\(slot) directory found, but All\(slot) directory exists.

  Discarded the beloved Customizable report syntax that dates all the way
  back to Leladia's, in favor of a much more flexible xslt implementation.
  This means that earlier 'custom reports' must be rewritten in xslt. See
  DefaultConfigReport.xsl for a fairly complete example.  Lots of most
  requested changes to this report!

  The same xslt change has been applied to the custom UI Window beta
  feature from earlier versions.  Here, too, any UI Window templates
  must be written in xslt.  This is a two-pass flavor to allow the window
  positions to be updated, see DefaultUiXmlWindow.xsl for an example,
  with DefaultUiXmlWindowPost.xsl as the second pass.

  Added a File - Export SCTemplate XML option; it is a template with much
  too much data so that report authors can examine every field available
  for report authors to include in their xslt report formats.

  The report window now remembers the last directory used to save reports.

  Corrected Move Item so even drop items can be moved from slot to slot
  (the entire item, not just the gems).  Also fixed a Swap Gems bug.

  Fixed a flaw that Edit - Item Type was creating a new item, instead
  of modifying the current item.

  Fixed a bug in Materials reports for new armors and other non-imbued
  item bonuses that caused the report to crash.

  Fixed the escape key within the dropdown lists.  Escape will not change
  the previously selected item when it closes the dropdown list.

  Qt 4.2 is now strongly recommended to enable all of the layout features
  and easiest-to-use interface.  Several 4.2-specific crash bugs fixed.
  Version 4.2.1 is now packaged in the Windows installer.

Updated 10/16/2006 - Version 1.91

  Ensure all item variants for each slot are correctly saved.

  Recall a crafted item's name when it's loaded again.

  Recall the most recently used Realm on startup.

  File menu option 'Item Database Path' will change the path of the items
  tree (containing All/Albion/Hibernia/Midgard directory trees) and even
  create all the realm subdirs and item slot sub-subdirs.

  If 'Load Item' isn't pointing to a Realm/Slot/ directory tree, stop
  showing the filesystem root.  For 'Save Item', prompt to save the item
  file with it's filename (the Item_Name_slot.xml), and don't create the
  subdirectories automatically (for users who don't care for the layout).

  Load Item's dropdown directory name (up top) will show the equivilant
  realm/slot directory for each realm if the Coop option is set, and
  always show the All/slot crossrealm directory name.

  Show the Gem's name in the config report (broken in 1.90).  Also added
  the 6th player and 11th, 12th crafted slots to the config.

  Fixed 'Save Item', which was broken in 1.90.

Updated 10/07/2006 - Version 1.90

  This version, 1.90 is leading to the new 2.0 version.  Please consider
  this version experimental for now, do not overwrite your old template
  or item files that are important to you!  With the substantial changes
  listed below, please expect some bugs and report them to the project
  at http://sourceforge.net/projects/kscraft and click on 'Bugs'.

  You can leave feedback about these changes in the Users forum (choose
  'Forums' from the menu at the project page.)  Until version 2.0 is
  released, the project will continue to offer the prior version 1.45,
  which is considered stable.

  Completely overhauled the UI from Qt3.3 to Qt4.1 (the GUI library used
  to create and manage the screens).  Some of the controls and options
  change behavior slightly because Qt4.1 is vastly different.  This was
  necessary to simplify the licensing under the GPL while improving the
  interface on Windows.  With Qt4.1, sip and PyQt, the program now works
  well (without any extra patches) on Mac/Aqua or Unix/X11.

  Drop v.s. Crafted Item are now folded into each item, selected from the
  item name dropdown (top right corner of the item display.)  Multiple drop
  and crafted items may be stored in each slot!  Edit menu's New Item, 
  Move Item, and Delete Item let you manage the list of items in the slot,
  and File - Load Item will load it's new item at the front of the list.
  Edit the name in the displayed box to change the item name is (typing
  a few characters in that box does not look up an item by name.)

  The Item's Load/Save/Craft/Clear buttons can now be found in the menu,
  under File - Load/Save Item, Edit - Clear Item and View - Gem Crafting.
  Hotkeys make these easier to reach (except for Clear Item, too dangerous.)

  Introduce the many crafted item bonuses and tincture effects available, 
  in the 4th - 6th slots, as applicable.  See the Edit - Item Type submenu.
  No hints are offered for which bonus-by-item, since they are still in flux.
  Check the item itself for its bonus, and please report to us any missing
  crafted bonus.  There is a table of armor bonuses at www.craftsage.com.

  Added the optional 'Requirement' to every non-crafted item slot.  For
  example, Legendary melee/magic/archery bonus is "vs. Monsters", some
  effects might be "Level ##", while Artifacts may be "Artifact Level #"

  Item Price is now displayed.  Item Cost (until crafted) is now based 
  on the (fractional!) estimate of how many gem makes, and that is based 
  on the quality of the gems chosen.  Mark the gem Done in the Gem Crafting
  window (with the true number of remakes if any) to fix the exact cost.

  Template and item files are far smaller, because default/empty data isn't
  saved to the file.  Crafter's skill, material multipliers and other 
  preferences are no longer loaded from or saved to a template, since those
  options are specific to the -crafter's- own configuration.

  Export Gems to a specific character's .ini file now lists only crafters;
  the crafter character must already have a Spellcraft menu item on one 
  of their quickbars for the program to recognize them as a crafter.

  Export autoselects items who's gems are undone, and are the Active item.
  It Disable items with no craftable flavor, or all Unused slots.  Added
  the Spare item as an exportable slot, and you now specify the Bar, Row, 
  and Pos as the starting slot, it reports the last bar, row, pos used.

  Prevent albion tank templates from showing Slash/Crush/Thrust resists
  while delving skills or showing skills while delving those resists.  Also
  prevents PvE Parry from being shown with Parry skill when delving either.

  Split Character.py tables apart from the constants.py module, so these 
  Realm / Class / Race / Server lists might be used for other kinds of
  DAoC programs.

  Corrections to MultiTabBar and SearchingCombo controls, so that the form
  won't do unexpected things (when alt-tabbing between the game for example.)

  Players told us they were confused by the existing 'template changed'
  warning popup, so it will now pop up a Save Template? question with
  Yes, No, or Cancel options.  The program now correctly tracks if a template
  has changed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updated 06/09/2006 - Version 1.45

  Thanks to Mythic's generous policy and their specific permission to this
  project to borrow their in-game gem toolbar artwork with the appropriate 
  acknowledgement, redo the introduction splash screen and About box!  /salute

  Fixed keys on the drop lists and tab buttons, the Alt key amoung others
  was switching choices, causing alot of frustration for alt-tabbers.

  When using the Open Item dialog, only a list, not file details (date, type
  etc) will be displayed next to the preview window.

  If a filename is given to Spellcraft.pyw or the compiled program, open
  it on startup (loaded before the window is displayed).

  Improved the Config reports.  Added PvE Bonus entries under other bonuses.
  Have dropped unused items (not slots) from the list.

Updated 05/21/2006 - Version 1.44

  Fixed Windows 98/ME font selection.  With Unicode for Windows, Qt was
  getting horribly confused by the standard font 'Trebuchet MS'.

  Create a more windows-like list of Menu tabs, File Edit View etc...
  and create an Errors menu item to collect a clickable menu list
  off all the template errors.

  Removed the error label fields from the window, displaying more
  of the Other Bonuses list at one time.

  Restore everyone's favorite quick-change, view Distance to Cap,
  as a View menu item (with a check mark to indicate when active).

  Eliminate the possibility of > 94 quality 'Unused' gems, unused are
  always 94 for blowup computation.

  Remember the 'amount' when switching from type to type, such as when
  the user changes 5 str to 5 dex.

  Add 'Elf' to Blademaster's choice of races, 'Shield' skill to Wardens, 
  removed Arborial Path Focus from VW (not affected anymore), and
  identified servers Akatsuki #145 and Glastonbury #20 for export gems.

  Fix distance-to-cap of Focus pseudo-skill.  Now compares focus level
  to the character's level.

  Fix export-toolbars to export stats and resists!  These were missing
  the suffix ' Jewel' in the name of the gems causing only skills and
  focus gems to be exported.

  Very experimental 'other...' bonuses and effects added, allowing the
  unusual bonus or effect to be typed in by the user.

  Very experimental 'Effects' added.  Craftable items allows the choice
  of one Alchemy Tincture to apply. For drop items allows to choose the
  various offensive/reactive/charged or other (such as casted) effects.
  These are not priced now, because the cost and price of the tincture
  might not follow the costing rules of the current cost options, or
  they might be customer-provided or even customer-applied.

  Shrunk the size of saved template files by omitting any slot with no
  effect ('Unused').

  Behave nicely if the source-code user doesn't choose to install psyco.
  This has no effect on folks who grab the installer.

Updated 11/28/05 - Version 1.43.0011 (dev)

  Moved 'Distance To Cap' to the Options window, save user's preference.

  Remember the preference for Options - Include Done in Material list,
  and Options - Coop/PvP server items check boxes.

  Fixed the materials/costs of the Catacombs Brilliant and Finesse gems.
  Fix materials window, when clicking a gem name, so the multiplier works.

  Axed the 'Focus' list.  All Focuses are now listed under the Skills list.

  Fixed the config report for 'All Spell Lines Focus' to show all focuses
  (was dropping the first focus for the class.)

  The [...] button for an item's level is a bit more useful & informative.

  Cloth armor (any item with the same DPSAF as it's level) will be
  reduced one level for computation of available imbue points.

  Fixed the materials 'save as text' button, broken since the new Qt 3.4.

  Fixed the 'delve', when clicking on stats, to pull up stat caps,
  and when clicking on this toon's casting stat it also pulls up all 
  of the 'Acuity' stat and cap bonuses; when clicking any power bonus
  pull up all related power, % power pool and power cap bonuses; and
  includes Skill and Focus bonuses when delving either on a caster.

  Fixed loading a template, such that the chest piece doesn't become
  a crafted item upon loading a saved template with a drop chest.
  'Other Bonuses' list is now clickable (delves items with other skill).

  Improve display on Mac/Aqua (still looks odd, and breaks Aqua rules).

  Now importing older 'PvE' category as 'PvE Bonus' category.

  Corrected caps for imported 'Healing Effectiveness', 'Duration of Spells'
  and added 'Spell Piercing' bonus (as Mythic named it, not Resist Pierce).

  Sorcerer +Mind fixed to display for +All Magic (even with no real benefit).
  Ranger's Pathfinding skill changed from +all magic, to an 'other' skill.
  Removed Valewalker Aboreal Focus, testing shows -no- gain, anymore.

  Fixed two-row MultiTabBar so all the quirks since 1.43.0009 are cleaned up.

  Added Offensive/Reactive/Charged/Other Effects slot types for drop items.


Updated 11/02/05 - Version 1.43.0010 (dev)

Added server codes for Hector, Deria, Cumbria.
Import non-Kort 'PvE' category as 'PvE Bonus' category.
Fix stat-cap cap (max +25 stat cap items at level 50).
Changed to a two-row-tabs layout of body & jewelry, without using tab 
pages which required all of the controls to be shifted back and forth.
Recoded the const tables to make them read-only (protection from bugs).
Reformatted tables and fixed some values (Briton Spirit resist, etc.)
Fixed SC Quickbar tables, but will be broken by future Mythic changes.
Extended Quickbars to 30 bars (1-10 on 1st bar, 11-30 on 2nd/3rd bars).
Added some of the new servers for the Fill in Quickbars feature.

Ehrayn Updated 3/18/05 - Patch 1.0.7
